        <p>Three interesting thigns about me: 
            I have a kind of bent spine. It's not scoliosis where it bends to the side but it bends inwards towards my organs.
            I have lived in the same house for near my entire life, except for the first few months after I was born.
            I like history but mostly nature documentaries, the visuals are amazing.
            I'm studying computer science because it was recommended to me by my mom since I didn't really have a preference for what I studied in college.
